This guide describes how to perform a bulk migration of your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito User Pool to Supabase Auth. Unfortunately, this guide does not handle the migration of secrets such as Single Sign On (SSO) Identity Providers and Multi Factor Authentication devices. You will need to re-register [MFA factors](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa) and [Single Sign On Identity Provider](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml)

We primarily focus on two cases:

1. You have email password logins
2. You have email and password logins in addition to OAuth logins.

You can export users via any one of the three approaches:

1. Lambda Trigger
2. Bulk Export Script
3. Foreign Data Wrapper

AWS also provides a [reference architecture for user exports](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture/)
